    "summaries": "The defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court declaring him a probation violator. The defendant asserted that the trial justice erred in finding him in violation of his probation for not satisfying his restitution payments by the time his sentence was to expire and erred in extending his sentence by delaying imposition of the sentence for the violation in order to monitor his payment progress. <br> <br>The Supreme Court concluded that the trial justice's finding that the defendant was a probation violator for failure to pay restitution in full, without an assessment of the defendant's ability to pay or whether the defendant's failure to pay the full amount of restitution was willful, deliberate, or in defiance of his obligations, was arbitrary and capricious. The Supreme Court acknowledged that a restitution payment obligation, such as the defendant's obligation, need not be linked to the duration of a sentence and, rather, becomes a civil judgment after expiration of a sentence. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the Superior Court was without authority to extend the defendant's sentence in order to oversee his payment progress and that the defendant only remained civilly liable to pay restitution. Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated the order of the Superior Court.<br>",

On appeal, the defendant alleged that the trial justice erred in (1) denying her motions to suppress the evidence found at her apartment, (2) denying her motion to suppress the evidence found in her vehicle, and (3) violating her right to confront a witness about promises, rewards, and inducements.<br><br>The Supreme Court held that the defendant waived her claim that the search warrant for her apartment lacked particularity, because she did not raise it before the trial justice nor did it fall within the exception to the raise-or-waive rule there was a substantial basis in the affidavit to establish probable cause to issue the warrant and the trial justice did not err in denying her request for a Franks hearing. Because the Supreme Court concluded the warrant was valid, the Court did not consider defendant's argument that the trial justice erred in relying on the good-faith exception.<br> <br>The Supreme Court then determined that the warrantless vehicle seizure did not violate defendant's rights under the collective-knowledge doctrine, Connecticut law enforcement officers properly relied on information provided by the Pawtucket Police Department to establish probable cause that the defendant's vehicle contained evidence of a crime. <br> <br>Lastly, the Supreme Court determined that the defendant failed to preserve a Confrontation Clause issue for appeal because defendant did not raise the argument before the trial justice.<br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court.",

DCYF took Mr. Lacera's biological grandchild into custody and placed the child with a nonrelative foster family. Mr. Lacera commenced efforts to secure placement of the child. After efforts were unsuccessful, Mr. Lacera filed a petition for declaratory judgment seeking declaration that DCYF violated his statutory rights to priority placement and adoption of the child as a fit and willing relative pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 14 1 27(c). By the time Mr. Lacera filed the petition, however, the Family Court had terminated Mr. Lacera's son's parental rights to the child. <br><br>DCYF moved to dismiss the petition on the pleadings. The hearing justice determined that Mr. Lacera lacked standing to bring the petition and granted DCYF's motion to dismiss. Mr. Lacera appealed, maintaining that he had standing to pursue his declaratory-judgment petition. The Supreme Court held that Mr. Lacera lacked standing to bring the petition because any statutory rights Mr. Lacera had with respect to his biological grandchild were derivative of his son's, and they therefore were extinguished when his son's parental rights were terminated. <br> <br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the order of the Family Court.<br><br>",

Ms. Tiernan challenged a decision of ERSRI which, pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 36 10 31, offset a workers' compensation award against her accidental disability pension amounts paid pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 28 33 45.<br><br>In March 2009, Ms. Tiernan, a state employee, retired as a member of ERSRI on an accidental disability pension. Prior to her retirement, Ms. Tiernan had received workers' compensation benefits. Upon her retirement, she petitioned the Workers' Compensation Court for a \"coordinated benefit\" under \u00a7 28-33-45. Because Ms. Tiernan's accidental disability pension was less than the amount of workers' compensation she was receiving prior to her retirement, the Workers' Compensation Court supplemented Ms. Tiernan's retirement by awarding a coordinated benefit.<br><br>Based on this new workers' compensation award, ERSRI notified Ms. Tiernan that it would offset the coordinated benefit against her accidental disability pension, as required by \u00a7 36 10 31.<br><br>Ms. Tiernan contested this decision, ultimately exhausting her administrative remedies and appealing the agency action to the Superior Court, which affirmed. Before the Supreme Court, Ms. Tiernan maintained that she was entitled to both her full accidental disability pension and her coordinated benefit without a corresponding reduction to her pension. Ms. Tiernan argued that the legislative intent expressed in the coordinated-benefits provision, \u00a7 28-33-45, should control.<br><br>The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court and ultimately the decision of ERSRI to offset the amounts she received as a coordinated benefit against Ms. Tiernan's accidental disability retirement pension.

Applying principles of statutory construction, the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 36-10-31 applied to a more narrow classification of retirees and therefore should control in this case, a construction which allowed the intent of the Legislature as expressed in \u00a7 28-33-45 to stand with respect to non-ERSRI retirees.<br> <br>Therefore, the Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court judgment. <br>",

    "summaries": "The plaintiffs, Cody-Allen Zab and Jose R. Rivera, appealed from Superior Court judgments entered in favor of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, Director Patricia Coyne-Fague in her official capacity, and Global TelLink Corporation. Before the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims based on G.L. 1956 \u00a7 13-6-1, Rhode Island's civil death statute.<br><br>The Supreme Court first addressed Zab's claim that the civil death statute violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and concluded that the hearing justice properly dismissed Zab's federal claim on the merits. The Supreme Court recognized that, under the relevant federal statute, the DOC and the DOC Director were not \"persons\" and Zab had no right of action against them. <br><br>The Supreme Court then addressed plaintiffs' contentions that the civil death statute unconstitutionally divested the Superior Court of authority to hear their negligence claims. The Supreme Court concluded that the civil death statute violates article 1, section 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution because it denies plaintiffs of their fundamental right of access to the courts. The Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny and concluded that the state failed to demonstrate a compelling reason to override the right of access to the courts that is textually guaranteed by the Rhode Island Constitution.<br><br>The Supreme Court ultimately determined that the entirety of the civil death statute is unconstitutional and in clear contravention of the provisions of article 1, section 5, of the Rhode Island Constitution because it deprives those persons imprisoned at the Adult Correctional Institutions for life of their right to bring civil actions in our state courts. <br> <br>",

The trial justice granted its motion, and the plaintiffs appealed.<br> <br>The Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs were not the insureds under defendant's insurance policy, nor assignees for purposes of a bad-faith claim.

Because the Supreme Court concluded that the trial justice had properly determined the extent and value of the marital estate and then equitably distributed those assets between the parties, the Court declined to address whether the increase in value of an asset acquired by a spouse prior to marriage, and solely titled in that spouse's name, includes the reduction of a mortgage paid with marital funds.<br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision pending entry of final judgment of the Family Court.",
