      "Description0": "The defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court declaring him a probation violator.&nbsp; The defendant asserted that the trial justice erred in finding him in violation of his probation for not satisfying his restitution payments by the time his sentence was to expire and erred in extending his sentence by delaying imposition of the sentence for the violation in order to monitor his payment progress. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court concluded that the trial justice’s finding that the defendant was a probation violator for failure to pay restitution in full, without an assessment of the defendant’s ability to pay or whether the defendant’s failure to pay the full amount of restitution was willful, deliberate, or in defiance of his obligations, was arbitrary and capricious.&nbsp; The Supreme Court acknowledged that a restitution payment obligation, such as the defendant’s obligation, need not be linked to the duration of a sentence and, rather, becomes a civil judgment after expiration of a sentence.&nbsp; Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the Superior Court was without authority to extend the defendant’s sentence in order to oversee his payment progress and that the defendant only remained civilly liable to pay restitution.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated the order of the Superior Court.<br>",

      "Description0": "The defendant, Tre’arra Hudgen, appealed from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for first-degree murder, discharge of a firearm when committing a crime of violence that caused death, conspiracy to assault with a firearm, felony assault with a firearm, first-degree robbery, and carrying a revolver without a license or permit.&nbsp; On appeal, the defendant alleged that the trial justice erred in (1) denying her motions to suppress the evidence found at her apartment, (2) denying her motion to suppress the evidence found in her vehicle, and (3) violating her right to confront a witness about promises, rewards, and inducements.<br><br>The Supreme Court held that the defendant waived her claim that the search warrant for her apartment lacked particularity, because she did not raise it before the trial justice nor did it fall within the exception to the raise-or-waive rule; there was a substantial basis in the affidavit to establish probable cause to issue the warrant; and the trial justice did not err in denying her request for a Franks hearing.&nbsp; Because the Supreme Court concluded the warrant was valid, the Court did not consider defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in relying on the good-faith exception.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court then determined that the warrantless vehicle seizure did not violate defendant’s rights; under the collective-knowledge doctrine, Connecticut law enforcement officers properly relied on information provided by the Pawtucket Police Department to establish probable cause that the defendant’s vehicle contained evidence of a crime. <br>&nbsp;<br>Lastly, the Supreme Court determined that the defendant failed to preserve a Confrontation Clause issue for appeal because defendant did not raise the argument before the trial justice.<br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court.

      "Description0": "The defendant, Richard C. Bicknell, appealed from a final judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, Shirley P. Morgan, in her capacity as Administratrix for the Estate of Lisa A. Bicknell, following the grant of summary judgment in accordance with Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; The defendant argued that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the decedent’s failure to change the beneficiary on her retirement plan constituted a waiver of the defendant’s waiver of his interest in the retirement account under a Property Settlement Agreement (PSA) entered into in the Family Court in a divorce matter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court concluded that the decedent’s failure to remove the defendant as the beneficiary of the retirement plan was of no moment because this would not affect the defendant’s waiver contained in the PSA.&nbsp; Therefore, the Court held that this was a matter of contract interpretation and, thus, the PSA controlled the merits of this appeal. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court held that the PSA clearly and unambiguously stated that the defendant waived “any and all interest” in the retirement plan and that there was no evidence of any modification or waiver of the PSA in writing as required by the PSA.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Court held that no genuine issue of material fact remained in dispute and that the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff.<br><br>Therefore, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.",

      "Description0": "In these consolidated cross-appeals, the defendant, Leart Mezini, challenged the trial justice’s equitable distribution of property, contending that the trial justice either erred in his designation of property as marital or abused his discretion in awarding the plaintiff, Elida Mezini, certain property. The plaintiff contended that the trial justice erred in failing to award her one-half of the value of the reduction of the mortgage on the marital domicile.<br><br>The Supreme Court held that the trial justice did not err in any of his designations or distributions of property. The Supreme Court determined that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence because he assessed the parties’ credibility and thoroughly examined the factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a) in making the distributions. Because the Supreme Court concluded that the trial justice had properly determined the extent and value of the marital estate and then equitably distributed those assets between the parties, the Court declined to address whether the increase in value of an asset acquired by a spouse prior to marriage, and solely titled in that spouse’s name, includes the reduction of a mortgage paid with marital funds.<br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision pending entry of final judgment of the Family Court.

The Supreme Court determined that the trial justice properly exercised his judgment in analyzing the evidence presented and the credibility of the witnesses, did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and sufficiently articulated his reasons for his decision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court. <br>",

      "Description0": "The defendants appealed from a Superior Court judgment arising from their sale of real property with improvements that encroached upon an adjacent lot.&nbsp; The trial justice found that the defendants were liable for the plaintiffs’ damages arising from that sale and that defendant Joseph Miller’s insurer was not liable for his intentional acts.&nbsp; The defendants asserted that the insurer’s liability in a separate and unrelated matter should have been accounted for in determining its liability in this matter; the defendants also raised issues with an amended pleading, trial events as reflected on the docket, language used in the judgment, and defendant Lynne Miller’s counsel’s lack of communication with her regarding trial outcomes. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Supreme Court concluded that the issues raised by the defendants regarding the insurer’s liability in another action, the amended pleading, and the language in the judgment were all precluded for review by the Court according to the raise-or-waive rule.&nbsp; The Supreme Court addressed the defendants’ concerns about the events as reflected in the docket, concluding that those events were ordinary trial practice and procedure.&nbsp; The Court declined to review the defendants’ issue with counsel, as it was not properly before the Court, having not first been raised in the trial court.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. <br><br>&nbsp;<br>",

      "Description0": "The state sought, by way of certiorari, review of a District Court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Providence Place Group Limited, Partnership and Rouse Providence LLC. The state contended that the District Court judge erred by improperly weighing evidence; failing to address the issue of assignability or transferability of tax exemptions; and failing to construe and apply the tax-exemption provisions of the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 64 of title 42, so as to not violate the nondelegation doctrine of the Rhode Island Constitution.<br><br>The Supreme Court held that there were no material facts in dispute that were outcome-determinative and that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Supreme Court determined that the General Assembly clearly and unambiguously indicated that the Providence Place Mall was to remain a project of the Economic Development Corporation post-construction. The Supreme Court further concluded that § 42-64-20(c) exempted the mall from imposition of a real estate conveyance tax and that the delegation of powers to the Economic Development Corporation was constitutionally permissible because the standards accompanying the delegation were clear. The Supreme Court therefore affirmed the judgment of the District Court.",

      "Description0": "The defendant, Juan P. Benitez, appealed from a July 28, 2017 judgment of conviction and commitment on one count of second-degree child molestation entered following a jury trial .&nbsp; On appeal, the defendant contended that: (1) “the trial court erred when it permitted [a physician testifying as an expert witness] to testify to hearsay statements unrelated to medical diagnosis or treatment;” and (2) “the trial court impermissibly allowed the state to mislead the jury by impeaching a witness with a statement he did not author, sign, or review .”<br><br>The Supreme Court held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting certain hearsay statements pursuant to the medical diagnosis or treatment exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; The Court further opined that, even if it had been an abuse of discretion to allow the testimony at issue, the testimony was cumulative and harmless .&nbsp; The Supreme Court further held that the defendant’s contentions with respect to the purported impeachment of a certain witness were waived .&nbsp; Consequently, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.
